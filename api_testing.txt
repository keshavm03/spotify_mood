Absolutely! Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to test your Spotify API manually using Postman — no prior experience needed:

Step-by-step: Test Spotify Recently Played API in Postman
1. Download and install Postman
Go to https://www.postman.com/downloads/

Download the version for your OS and install it.

2. Open Postman
Launch Postman after installation.

3. Create a new GET request
Click New (top left) → Select Request

Give it a name like Spotify Recently Played and save it in a collection or skip saving.

4. Enter the request URL
In the URL input field (middle top), paste:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/recently-played
5. Set the Authorization header
Click on the Headers tab below the URL bar.

Add a new header:

Key	Value
Authorization	Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN

Replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with the actual access token string you got from Spotify.

6. Send the request
Click the Send button (blue button on the right).

7. View the response
Scroll down to see the response body.

If successful, you will see JSON data with a key "items" containing your recently played tracks.

Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "items": [
    {
      "track": {
        "name": "Song Title",
        "artists": [{"name": "Artist Name"}],
        ...
      },
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
If you see "items": [] (empty array), it means no recent tracks found.

Troubleshooting tips
If you get 401 Unauthorized or Invalid token, your access token might be expired or wrong.

Make sure your token has the user-read-recently-played scope.

Make sure you’re using the correct token for the Spotify user who has actually played music.

Optional: How to get an access token?
Usually you get this after Spotify OAuth login.

If you want, I can help you with a quick way to get a token via Spotify’s Console.
